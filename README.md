## Who's the Starter for?

This starter is for those who with basic knowledge of React and have the need for building a server-side app. In other words, it's not for a newbie. If you're new to React or you don't need a server-side rendering app, I'd recommend you give [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) a try.

## Some Feature Branches

* Simplfied action creator version: [simple-action](https://github.com/wellyshen/react-cool-starter/tree/simple-action) branch.
* Docker-ise support: [docker](https://github.com/wellyshen/react-cool-starter/tree/docker) branch.
* [webpack-isomorphic-tools](https://github.com/catamphetamine/webpack-isomorphic-tools) version: [webpack-isomorphic-tools](https://github.com/wellyshen/react-cool-starter/tree/webpack-isomorphic-tools) branch.

## Requirements

* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 6.0
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) >= 3.0

## Getting Started

**1. You can start by cloning the repository on your local machine by running:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wellyshen/react-cool-starter.git
cd react-cool-starter
```

**2. Install all of the dependencies:**

```bash
yarn
```

**3. Start to run it:**

```bash
yarn start:production    # Building bundle and running production server
```

Now the app should be running at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

> Note: You can change the port that you want from `./package.json`.

## NPM Script Commands

I use [better-npm-run](https://github.com/benoror/better-npm-run) to manage the scripts in a better way, which also provides the compatibility of cross-platform. All of the scripts are listed as following:

| `yarn <script>`    | Description                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `start`            | Run your app on the development server at `localhost:3000`. HMR will be enabled.           |
| `start:dashboard`  | The same with `start` and webpack bundle info will be turned into dashboard mode.          |
| `start:production` | Bundle files to `./public/assets` and run it on the production server at `localhost:8080`. |
| `start:prod`       | Run your app on the production server only at `localhost:8080`.                            |

| `lint`             | Lint all `.js` and `.scss` files.                                                          |
| `lint:js`          | Lint all `.js` files (Use `--fix` to auto fix eslint errors).                              |
| `lint:style`       | Lint all `.scss` files (Use `--fix` to auto fix stylelint errors).                         |

| `flow:stop`        | Stop type checking.                                                                        |
| `test`             | Run testing once (with code coverage reports).                                             |
| `test:watch`       | Run testing on every test file change.                                                     |
| `clean:all`        | Remove the client/server bundled stuff and the coverage report.                            |
| `clean:build`      | Remove the `./public/assets` folder to clean the client bundled files.                     |
| `clean:test`       | Remove the `./coverage` folder to clean the code coverage report.                          |

## Server-Side Security and Performance

Concerning the security and performance of Express in production, I already setup some middleware for you:

* [helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) - Helps secure Express server with various HTTP headers.
* [hpp](https://github.com/analog-nico/hpp) - Express middleware to protect against HTTP Parameter Pollution attacks.
* [compression](https://github.com/expressjs/compression) - Gzip compression support for speeding up Express server responses.

> Note: It's just a basic protected mechanism for your app, you can see the [security best practices](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-security.html) for more advanced configuration.

## Setup Redux DevTools Extension

The [Redux Devtools Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) let us wire up our Redux app to a time-traveling debugger. It's enabled in development only. You can follow these installation guides to use it:

**For Chrome**

* from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd);
* or build it with `npm i && npm run build:extension` and [load the extension's folder](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) `./build/extension`;
* or run it in dev mode with `npm i && npm start` and [load the extension's folder](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) `./dev`.

**For Firefox**

* from [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remotedev/);
* or build it with `npm i && npm run build:firefox` and [load the extension's folder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox) `./build/firefox` (just select a file from inside the dir).

**For Electron**

* just specify `REDUX_DEVTOOLS` in [`electron-devtools-installer`](https://github.com/GPMDP/electron-devtools-installer).

**For other browsers and non-browser environment**

* use [`remote-redux-devtools`](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/remote-redux-devtools).

## Overview

### Stateless Functional Components

[React 0.14](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html) introduced a simpler way to define components called [stateless functional components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/components-and-props.html). These components are written in plain javascript functions. In the starter boilerplate I use it wherever possible.

### Adding Routes

This starter use [React Router v4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) library to manage our routes. For the purpose of SSR with data pre-fetched, I put the routes in a centralized [Route Config](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/route-config). You can setup your routes in `./src/routes.js`. For example:

```javascript
import RouteComponent from './containers/RouteComponent';

// ...

export default [
  {
    // Define your route path
    path: '/TopPath',
    // If the route matches the location.pathname exactly or not (used for index route usually)
    exact: true,
    // Add your route component here
    component: RouteComponent,
    // Add your sub route component here
    routes: [
      {
        path: '/TopPath/SubPath',
        component: SubRouteComponent
      }
    ]
    // ...
  }
  // Setup other route components...
];
```

### Data Fetching from Server-side

Just write Redux actions and stores as normal (read the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) docs if you are new). The starter using [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) as the data fetcher, it's quite simple and easy to use. If the action creator is asynchronous then it will return a Promise (or a Promise.all) in the inner function.

Register the action(s) in `./src/routes.js`, which have to be called from server-sdie:

```javascript
// ...

export default [
  {
    path: '/TopPath',
    exact: true,
    component: RouteComponent,
    // Actions in the loadData function will be fetched from server-side
    loadData: () => [
      myReduxAction()
      // Add other pre-fetched actions here
    ]
  }
  // ...
];
```

The action(s) will be dispatched through `./src/server.js` on server-side:

```javascript
// ...

app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  // ...

  // Here's the method for loading data from server-side
  const loadBranchData = (): Promise<any> => {
    const branch = matchRoutes(routes, req.path);

    const promises = branch.map(({ route, match }) => {
      if (route.loadData) {
        return Promise.all(
          route
            .loadData({ params: match.params, getState: store.getState })
            .map(item => store.dispatch(item))
        );
      }

      return Promise.resolve(null);
    });

    return Promise.all(promises);
  };

  // ...
});

// ...
```

On client-side, don't forget to invoke the action(s) in `componentDidMount`. This ensures that if the component is reached on the client, then the same actions will be invoked. It's up to the action(s) to figure out if fetches for data need to be made or not:

```javascript
componentDidMount() {
  // Invoke your redux action(s) for client rendering
  this.props.myReduxAction();
}
```

### Code Splitting

One great feature of the web is that you don’t have to make your visitors download the entire app before they can use it. You can think of code splitting as incrementally downloading the app. It divides your code into small pieces called “chunks” to reduce the size of bundle loaded by user. Reducing the size of a chunk makes it load and run faster.

To accomplish this, I integrate [loadable-components](https://github.com/smooth-code/loadable-components) into this starter. The reason I choose the library is because of its design philosophy of SSR. It works seamless with the starter rather than others. Let’s see how we split our app by route:

I use the following folder/file structure:

```
 |- containers
    |- AsyncRouteComponent
       |- index.js          // Wrap the route component as async component
       |- RouteComponent.js // The route component
```

The `index.js` will be:

```javascript
import loadable from 'loadable-components';

import { Error, Loading } from '../../components';

export default loadable(
  () => import('./AsyncRouteComponent'), // Import your async route component here
  {
    ErrorComponent: Error, // Error component for displaying error message
    LoadingComponent: Loading // Loading component will be displayed when the component is being loaded
  }
);
```

Then you can [setup](#adding-routes) the route as usual.

> Note: I just show a general case route-based splitting, however you can even split your app by component-based depends on your need. For more advanced configuration you can refer to the [docs](https://github.com/smooth-code/loadable-components) of loadable-components.

### Managing Title, Meta, Styles and Scripts

The parent `App.js` defines the base title and meta in a `<Helmet {...config.app} />` component. Any sub-component can override/add properties (supports meta, link, script, style tags and html attributes). See the [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) documents for more info.

### App config

You can store app settings under `./src/config`. By default the `default.js` will be loaded. If the `process.env.NODE_ENV` matches to production, the `prod.js` will be used instead, and it inherits the data info from `default.js`.

You can access the correct config with:

```javascript
import config from './config';
```

### Styles

The starter supports CSS, SASS and [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-Modules/css-Modules) is enabled by default. I use [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-loader) plugin to parse CSS and add autoprefixer to your stylesheet. You can access your stylesheet with two ways.

With CSS modules:

```javascript
import styles from './styles.scss';

// ...

render() {
  return (
    <div className={styles.myClass}>   // The className matches one of CSS classes in your SCSS file
      <Helmet title="Home" />
      {this.renderUserList()}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Without CSS modules (you need to turn off CSS modules from `./tools/webpack/config.babel.js`):

```javascript
import './styles.scss';

// ...

render() {
  return (
    <div className="myClass">    // Use the CSS class as normal
      <Helmet title="Home" />
      {this.renderUserList()}
    </div>
  );
}
```

By the way, if you want to use your based style or a vendor CSS framework, just import it through the `./src/containers/App/index.js` file, for example:

```javascript
import '../../theme/normalize.css'; // Import a vendor stylesheet here
import styles from './styles.scss'; // Import your based stylesheet here

export default routes => {
  // ...
};
```

For the better development experience, don't forget to include those files in the `./src/helpers/renderHtml.js`, for example:

```javascript
// ...

  ${
    _.keys(assets.styles).length === 0
      ? `
        <style>
          // Include the vendor CSS framework and your own style here
          ${
            require('../theme/normalize.css')._style +
            require('../containers/App/styles.scss')._style +
            // Other styles...
          }
        </style>
      `
      : ''
  }

// ...
```

### Image and Font

It's super easy to render the image and font both on client and server, the usage would be like below.

Using image:

```javascript
// Require an image
<img src={require('./assets/logo.svg')} alt="Logo" role="presentation" />
```

Using font-awesome:

```javascript
// With CSS modules
import styles from './styles.scss';

// ...

return (
  <div>
    <div>
      <i className={styles.iconUser} /> Welly
    </div>
  </div>
);

// Without CSS modules
import './font-awesome.css';

// ...

return (
  <div>
    <div>
      <i className="fa fa-user" /> Welly
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

For using CSS modules, you have to set the proper font path in your scss/sass file:

```
$fa-font-path:"../node_modules/font-awesome/fonts";
@import "../node_modules/font-awesome/scss/font-awesome";
.icon-user {
  @extend .fa;
  @extend .fa-user;
}
```

### Material-UI with server-side render 😎 [material-ui server-rendering](https://material-ui-next.com/guides/server-rendering/)

Configuration file variables of global material-ui styles ./src/theme/materialTheme.js:

```
import { blueGrey, red } from 'material-ui/colors/index';
import { createMuiTheme } from 'material-ui/styles/index';

const theme = createMuiTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: blueGrey,
    accent: red,
    type: 'light'
  }
});

export default theme;
```

### Boost App Performance by Shallow Compare

If your React component's render() function renders the same result given the same props and state, you can use [React.PureComponent](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-api.html#react.purecomponent) for a performance boost.

React.PureComponent is exactly like React.Component but implements `shouldComponentUpdate()` with a shallow prop and state comparison. See the [Optimizing Performance](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/optimizing-performance.html#examples) topic for more info.

How we implemented the optimizing:

```javascript
import React, { PureComponent } from 'react';

// ...

class Home extends PureComponent {
  // Use PureComponent instead of Component
  // ...
}
```

### Type Checking by Flow

[Flow](https://flow.org), a static type checker for javascript. It adds static typing to javascript to improve developer productivity and code quality. In particular, static typing offers benefits like early error checking, which helps you avoid certain kinds of runtime failures, and code intelligence, which aids code maintenance, navigation, transformation, and optimization.

Flow’s static analysis makes building web apps with React safe by tracking the types of props and state. Flow understands which props are required and also supports default props.

I love to write React, Redux with Flow, I know it's not easy to learn at the beginning. But trust me, it's worth to learn. There're some useful instructions that I can give you as below:

* If you are new to Flow, read the official [docs](https://flow.org/en/docs/) to understand it.

* Learn how to use Flow with React from [here](https://flow.org/en/docs/react/).

* Here's [an example](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos-flow), which shows you the overall concept of integrating Flow with Redux.

Moreover, often you will want to use third-party libraries. For these circumstances, Flow supports the concept of a "libdef" ("Library Definition") which allows you to describe the interface and types of the library separate from the library and without needing to add types to or change the library itself. You can write a libdef file yourself if you need to or use [flow-typed](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed), which is a repository of third-party library interface definitions for use with Flow.

> Note: If you don't want to use Flow, just remove the `/* @flow */` comment and related typing definitions from each javascript file.

### JavaScript and Style Lint

[JavaScript lint](https://github.com/MoOx/eslint-loader) and [style lint](https://github.com/JaKXz/stylelint-webpack-plugin) are included into webpack compiling for runtime checking. If you want them to terminate webpack build process while an error occurs, you can enable those from `./tools/webpack/config.babel.js` (Default: false):

```javascript
// ...

// Enable build process terminated while there's an eslint error
const eslint = true;
// Enable build process terminated while there's a stylelint error
const stylelint = true;

// ...
```

### Unit Tests

This starter use [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as the testing engine. It runs in a Node environment, so you won't have access to the DOM. In addition, Jest support the feature of [snapshot testing](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/snapshot-testing.html#content), which is very powerful for testing React component. Give it a try, you'll be impressed.

I also use [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) as the testing utility for React, which makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components' output. The unit tests focus on three parts as below:

* React Components
* Actions
* Reducers

By the way, Jest built-in code coverage reports, the report files are generated in `./coverage` folder. You can configure `./package.json` to define which files that you want to cover. For example:

```
{
  // ...

  "jest": {
    "collectCoverageFrom": [
      "src/containers/**/*.js",   // Define the files, which want to be covered
      "src/components/**/*.js",
      "!src/**/__tests__"         // The files will be ignored by code coverage
    ],
    // Other configurations
  },

  // ...
}
```

You can also use [istanbul's ignore hints](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul/blob/master/ignoring-code-for-coverage.md#ignoring-code-for-coverage-purposes) to specify specific lines of code in a javascript file to skip code coverage.

## Troubleshooting

* If you get the the following errors, try to run `yarn build` to re-generate the necessary `webpack-assets.json` file for enable related assets (e.g. javascript, styles etc.) working on universal rendering.

  * > Cannot find module '../public/assets.json'
  * > Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)

* If you encounter the markup mismatches error (it's a react universal issue, which usually occurs due to the non-synchronized rendering result between client and server), you can do:

  * Restart the server to solve it.
  * Or for v16.1.0 up, you can use `suppressHydrationWarning` attribute for intentional client/server text mismatches ([#11126](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11126)).

* If you run the starter through a cloud computing service such as AWS EC2 instance etc. and you encounter an `UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning` like this [issue](https://github.com/wellyshen/react-cool-starter/issues/76). It might caused by the "openBrowser" tool. You can solve the issue like following.

In the `./package.json` script:

```
// ...

"start:prod": {
  "command": "node ./index.js",
  "env": {
    "NODE_PATH": "./src",
    "NODE_ENV": "production",
    "PORT": 8080,
    "BROWSER": "none"   // Add this node variable to turn off the open browser util
  }
},

// ...
```

* If you are on windows and encounter the following error: Expected linebreaks to be 'LF' but found 'CRLF' linebreak-style. The following rule must be added to `./package.json`.

```
"linebreak-style": 0
```

So it will look like:

```
// ...
 "rules": {
      "linebreak-style": 0,
      "global-require": 0,
// ...
```

## Todo...

There're some features (updates) which will be included in this starter in the near future:

* [ ] Code splitting for reducers.
* [ ] Upgrade to [Babel 7](https://babeljs.io/blog/2017/03/01/upgrade-to-babel-7) as soon as the stable version released.
* [ ] Upgrade to [Webpack 4](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/milestone/15) as soon as the stable version released.
