A simple but feature rich starter boilerplate for you to build an universal web application with the best development experience and best practices.

Built on the top of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux). Includes all the hot stuff and modern web development tools such as Webpack 2, [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/), React Hot Loader 3 and [Redux Devtools Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension). See section **“Features”** for more other awesome features you can expect.

I will improve this starter boilerplate continuously and keep all of the technologies on trend. Welcome to join me if you want. Hope you guys love it :)
